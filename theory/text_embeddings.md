Bag of Words (BoW):

Method: BoW represents text as a sparse vector where each dimension corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary, and the value in each dimension represents the frequency of that word in the text.
Context: BoW does not consider the order of words in the text or the context in which they appear. It treats each word independently.
Usage: BoW is simple and efficient but lacks context and semantic meaning. It is often used in text classification and information retrieval tasks.

Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW):

Method: CBOW is a neural network model that predicts a target word based on its context words. It is trained to predict the target word using a window of surrounding context words.
Context: CBOW considers the context of words within a fixed window size but does not capture the entire context of a sentence or document.
Usage: CBOW is used to generate dense word embeddings that capture semantic meaning and are used in various NLP tasks. Word2Vec can use CBOW.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):

Method: BERT is a transformer-based model that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks. It generates contextual embeddings for each token in the input text.
Context: BERT captures the entire context of a word within a sentence or document, generating embeddings that are sensitive to the surrounding context.
Usage: BERT embeddings are highly effective for a wide range of NLP tasks, especially those requiring an understanding of the meaning of words in context.
In summary, BoW is simple and efficient but lacks context, CBOW considers a limited context window to generate embeddings, and BERT generates contextual embeddings that capture the meaning of words in context. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the NLP task at hand.
